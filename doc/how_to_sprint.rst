What you need?
==============

  * A python aware code editor. There are many free options: Pycharm, Canopy,
    Spyder, emacs, vi(m), ...
  * An account on `github.com`
  * The `git` tool. OSX: Install Xcode command line tools.
    Windows: https://git-scm.com/download/. Linux: use your package manager
    (`yum`, `apt-get`).
  * A tool to quickly create and manager light development environments
  * [OPTIONAL] A C/C++ compiler (depending on the project you want to
    contribute to), or a Fortran compiler.
  * [OPTIONAL] Several Virtual Machines running different Operating Systems to
    test you changes on multiple platforms.


What you need to get comfortable with?
======================================

  * Working at the command line
  * `git`
  * Good coding practices (testing frameworks, styling tools, restructured text
    and documentation generators).
  * Debuggers and grep-type tools to find your way through new source code.


What you can contribute?
========================

List of ideas, requiring more and more technical knowledge of the package in
question:

  * Documentation improvements
  * Tutorial review
  * Example review
  * Example creation
  * Existing ticket review
  * Add unit tests
  * Bug fix tickets
  * Tutorial creation
  * New features tickets
  * Other PR review
  * Triage of issues

Three pieces of advice:

  * Your own needs are the best driver for open source contributions
  * If you don't know where to start, look for issues tagged `easy`
  * Ask current maintainers what would be the most helpful.


How to create development environments?
=======================================

Two most reliable (free) tools to provision development environments I know:

  * Enthought's ``EDM``
  * Continuum Analytics' ``miniconda``

+------------------------+------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
|                        |                     EDM                        |         Miniconda                                   |
+========================+================================================+=====================================================+
| 1. Download            | enthought.com/products/edm                     | conda.io/miniconda                                  |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| 2. Create a new env    | edm environments create --version 3.6 devenv   | conda create -n devenv python=3.6                   |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| 3. Activate new envir. | edm shell -e devenv                            | source activate devenv (Windows: activate devenv)   |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| 4. Add dependencies    | edm install "numpy==1.11.3-2" scipy            | conda install numpy=1.11 scipy                      |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| 5. Install package     | ~/.edm/envs/devenv/bin/python setup.py develop | ~/miniconda/envs/devenv/bin/python setup.py develop |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

More help? ``edm -h`` or ``conda -h`` commands.

The project contains C extensions?
----------------------------------
Some projects require a C/C++ compiler because contain C/C++ code or Cython
code which needs to get compiled.

  * On OSX and linux, you can typically use the native compiled (gcc). Use
    ``yum``/``apt-get`` or OSX command line tools to install it if needed.
  * On Windows, ... it is a mess. For Python2.7, you need to use VS2008. For
    Python 3.4, you need to use VS 2010. For Python 3.5 and 3.6, you need to
    use VS 2015. See https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/contributing.html
    for links to free installers.


How to contribute code?
=======================

The typical workflow
--------------------

  #. Identify a work item you want to contribute. **Think small**.

  #. Create a ticket for your work item **if it doesn't already exist**.

  #. Go to the package's github repository. Fork it into your account where you
     have push rights.

  #. Clone your fork locally::

        git clone https://github.com/<USER NAME>/sprint_tutorial

  #. Build the project into your dev environment. Run the test suite.

  #. Branch off to a new branch for your work item::

        git branch fix/bug_name
        git checkout fix/bug_name

  #. Make sure you are in the expected branch::

        git branch

  #. Do work. **STAY FOCUSED** and only address the work item you selected.

  #. Review what has been done with::

        git status
        git diff file1.py

  #. When a set of changes represent a step toward your goal, commit::

        git commit -m "TEST: add unit test to show the bug" file1.py file2.py ...

     Or make a more complete commit message using an editor::

        git commit file1.py file2.py ...

     and write the commit message in the editor git uses.

  #. Once you have done everything you want, push your branch to github::

        git push --set-upstream origin fix/bug_name

     or simply::

        git push

  #. Go to Github to make a `Pull Request` (PR) with your work. You should see
     your branch available for a PR in both your repo and in the upstream
     repository that you forked. Select the branch you would like to pull your
     branch into itself, and add a complete description.

  #. Check for the result of Continuous Integration (CI).

  #. Discuss your work with your reviewer. Implement fixes and improvements,
     and push again to your branch. Your PR will update automatically.

  #. If upstream master gets updated between your branch and the time your PR
     is merged, you will need to merge changes into your branch or rebase your
     branch onto the new one, and resolve any conflict::

        git remote add upstream git@github.com:jonathanrocher/sprint_tutorial

     if your project is ok with merge, it is easier::

        git checkout master
        git pull upstream master
        git checkout fix/bug_name
        git merge master
        git push

     If you project requires to rebase::

        git fetch upstream
        git rebase upstream/master

     But the hash of your current state will be changed, so if you have pushed
     before the rebase, your state will need to be forced pushed::

        git push --force

  #. Once the PR has been approved, it will be merged in the upstream project
     by someone who has push rights.

  #. After merge, there are 3 typical cleaning steps: delete the branch on the
     remote repositories (in github), update master locally, delete the branch
     locally::

        git checkout master
        git branch -d fix/bug_name

  #. GOTO 1.


Check-list before making a PR and requesting review.
----------------------------------------------------

That check-list depends on each project, but typically, you should think of the
following:

  * Tests pass locally
  * code conforms to pylint/flake8/pep8/styling
  * All new functions and classes have docstrings
  * Your branch is (re)based on the current master
  * CI tests are all green
  * Documentation is updated (if needed)
  * Changelog is updated (if needed)
  * Contributor document is updated (if needed)


When things go wrong with git
-----------------------------
Git is an incredibly powerful tool to manage code, but it is pretty easy to
mess up. It is ok, everyone messes up with ``git``. The good news is, you can
(almost) always recover from a mess up. If you have an issue, pause, think,
google, find a git guru!

Here are a few tricks to get out of common situations:

  * You have made a mess and want to erase all un-committed code (ALL FILES)::

        git reset --hard HEAD

  * You have made a mess in only 1 file::

        git checkout HEAD -- filename

  * You have committed too quickly, and want to include more files, or redo your
    commit message::

        git reset --soft HEAD^

  * You don't like where you are going and decide you want to go back in time,
    to a precise commit, look for the commit hash with::

        git log

    and then reset to that point::

        git reset --hard <HASH>

    You can also go back in time without loosing your work since then, just to
    check things out::

        git checkout <HASH>

  * You have pulled master or a collaborator's work and now have a conflict?
    Open the conflicted file in an editor, and merge lines manually. Then::

        git add filename

    to mark it as resolved. Your branch is back to being ready to be committed.

  * You would like to pause your work in progress without committing to do
    something else or switch to another branch that has conflicts::

        git stash

    When you are done, and want your changes back::

        git stash pop

    Note that you can stash multiple times. States are stored on a stack
    (FILO).
